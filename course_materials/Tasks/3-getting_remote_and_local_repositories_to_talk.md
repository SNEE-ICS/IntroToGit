# Getting remote and local repositories to talk

1. Open the folder of you newly cloned repository in VS Code. Type in `git status`. What do you get?

2. In the top level directory of your new project on VSCode, make a file called `README.md` and write some text in this file (e.g. ‘this is my first repository’). Save the file.

3. Type in `git status` in the terminal. What do you get?

4. Type `git add README.md` to stage your changes. Type in `git status` again. What do you get?

5. Type `git commit –m ‘my first commit’ to commit your changes. Type in `git status` again. What do you get?

6. Type `git push` to push your changes to Gitea. Go to your remote repository and check if the changes have been made?

7. Repeat and rinse! Try making some changes to your file and repeating the above process to commit a new set of edits. Or try writing some R/SQL/Python code and committing that.
