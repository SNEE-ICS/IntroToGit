# Getting remote and local repositories to talk

1. In your new project on VSCode, make a file called README.md and write some text in this file (e.g. ‘this is my first repository’). Save the file.

2. Type in `git status` in the terminal. What do you get?

3. Type `git add README.md` to stage your changes. Type in `git status` again. What do you get?

4. Type `git commit –m ‘my first commit’ to commit your changes. Type in `git status` again. What do you get?

5. Type `git push` to push your changes to Gitea. Go to your remote repository and check if the changes have been made?

6. Repeat and rinse!
