# Making a repository on Gitea

1. Navigate to your gitea home page, make sure you are signed in

2. Click the '+' simple in the top right corner, then 'new repository'

3. Give your repository a name in the box provided. Avoid spaces or unusual characters. Underscores are fine. If unsure you can use 'testrepo' or similar. Make sure that the owner is your own account (i.e. your Gitea username, and not an organisational account)

4. Leave all other options as is, and click 'create repository'. You should keep Gitea repositories private by default to minimise the risk of disclosing data.

5. And that's it, you've made your first repository!
