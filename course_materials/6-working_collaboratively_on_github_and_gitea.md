# Working collaboratively on Github and Gitea

## Issues

### Overview:

Issues serve as a centralized communication and tracking system for tasks, enhancements, bugs, and other project-related topics. They provide a space for collaboration, discussion, and assignment of work within a repository.

### How to Use:

1. **Create an Issue:**
   - Users can create new issues to report problems, propose new features, or discuss improvements.

2. **Assignees:**
   - Issues can be assigned to specific individuals or teams, indicating responsibility for addressing the task.

3. **Labels:**
   - Labels help categorize issues, providing additional context such as bug, enhancement, or priority level.

4. **Comments:**
   - Users can comment on issues, fostering collaborative discussions around problem-solving or planning.

## Pull Requests

### Overview:

Pull requests (PRs) are proposals for changes, typically associated with a branch. They allow contributors to submit modifications to the codebase for review and inclusion into the main branch.

### How to Use:

1. **Creating a Pull Request:**
   - Contributors initiate a PR by specifying the changes they've made in a branch and proposing to merge those changes into the main branch.

2. **Code Review:**
   - Team members can review the proposed changes, leave comments, and request modifications if needed.

3. **Automated Checks:**
   - Continuous Integration (CI) tools can be integrated to perform automated checks, ensuring that proposed changes meet quality standards.

4. **Merge or Close:**
   - Once the changes are reviewed and approved, the PR can be merged into the main branch. Alternatively, it can be closed if the changes are not accepted.

## Milestones

### Overview:

Milestones are used to group related issues and pull requests together, providing a way to track progress and manage work in larger increments.

### How to Use:

1. **Create a Milestone:**
   - Milestones can be created to represent specific project phases, releases, or thematic collections of work.

2. **Assigning Issues and PRs:**
   - Issues and pull requests can be associated with milestones, allowing for a more organized view of progress toward goals.

3. **Tracking Progress:**
   - Milestones provide a visual representation of the status of associated tasks, helping teams track overall project progress.

## Tags and Releases

### Overview:

Tags and releases are used to mark specific points in the project's history, often corresponding to version releases.

### How to Use:

1. **Creating Tags:**
   - Tags are specific points in the commit history that are labeled for easy reference, such as marking a stable release.

2. **Releases:**
   - Releases are a collection of tagged commits and associated assets. They represent a snapshot of the project at a particular point, often used for distribution.

3. **Changelog:**
   - Releases typically include a changelog summarizing the notable changes in that version.

## Projects

### Overview:

Projects provide a visual and structured way to manage and organize work within a repository. They can be customized to suit different workflows and methodologies.

### How to Use:

1. **Kanban Boards:**
   - Projects often include Kanban boards where issues or tasks can be organized into columns such as "To Do," "In Progress," and "Done."

2. **Custom Columns:**
   - Users can create custom columns to represent specific workflow stages, making it adaptable to the project's needs.

3. **Automation:**
   - Projects can include automation, linking issues and pull requests to specific columns based on their status or labels.

Working collaboratively using these concepts enhances communication, coordination, and transparency within a development or analytical team. These features, offered by platforms like GitHub and Gitea, streamline project management and contribute to the overall success of collaborative endeavors.
